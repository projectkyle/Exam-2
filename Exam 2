  *The questions are worth 120 points.  You have 120 minutes to do the exam, one point per minute.*
  *All answers should submitted electronically. Please submit all relevant computer files as a Slack message to me. I prefer .Rmd files __along with knit output,__ md or html is fine. Please no "pages" files, save output and code as pdf or rtf if you must.*
  *You may refer to your books, notes, calculator, computer, or astrology table.  The exam is "open book."*
  *However, you must not refer to anyone else, either in person or electronically, during the exam time. For instance, since these exam questions are newly created, posting questions or copying answers on Discord or WhatsApp groups or online homework helping sites or forums (such as Chegg, Yahoo answers or others) is a violation. Don't upload to public GitHub site until end of exam.*
*You must do all work on your own.  Cheating is harshly penalized.*
*Good luck.  Stay cool.*

For this exam we will use a new (to you) dataset, an update of NHIS. We'll look at estimates of whether people worked for an employer that offered health insurance, EMPHI. The data is available on Slack. (Note that in data, NIU is "Not in Universe" so for instance if people are asked if their employer offers health insurance then somebody not working would be NIU.)

The first questions do not require any work in R (although you might find it convenient, I'm not stopping you) -- I will provide some summary data and you can construct hypothesis tests on your own. Subsequent questions require R coding.

1. (20 points) I've run crosstabs on a subset of the data (so you cannot replicate, just use this info provided). These give verbose summary of whether employer offers health insurance by educational qualification and whether person is full or part time worker. Form a hypothesis test of the form, "people with *various* educational qualifications who are *full or parttime* have different fraction offered health insurance." I expect that you will choose different ways to operationalize educational qualification (compare above some level with below that level, but what level?). You can choose how to deal with NA and similar responses. I expect that different people may choose different levels of significance. Please provide estimate, standard error, t-stat and a p-value for the hypothesis test and a confidence interval. __Write a short paragraph__ explaining the test (carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test.

2. (20 points) Using a subset of the data (so you can do this question without R), the following coefficients are estimated in a logit model where employer offering health insurance depends on $Age$, $Age^2$, $Female$, and interaction of $Female$ with the age terms.

Variable       | Coeff    | Std Error
-------------- | -------  | ----------
$Age$          | -0.019   | 0.0018
$Age^2$        | 0.00002  | 0.000002
$Female$       | -0.470   | 0.1206
$Age*Female$   | 0.0082   | 0.0026
$Age^2*Female$ | -0.00001 | 0.000003
$Constant$     | 1.84     | 0.09

  a. What is the predicted probability that a 30-year-old person (not a female) will have a job with benefits?
  b. What is the predicted probability that a 30-year-old female person will have a job with benefits?
  c. Describe and explain the impact of the squared age terms in the model, for male and female.

3. (80 points) Now do your own analysis using "NHIS2020_data.RData". Explore likelihood of people working at a job that offers health insurance, or choose a different topic if you'd like. The data includes information on region, whether urban or rural area, usual hours of work, fulltime or parttime, health status, height, weight and BMI, along with demographics like age, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, family size, marital status, whether served in armed forces, citizenship with years in US, and household income.  
+ Choose a subgroup of the sample to consider and provide summary statistics of that subgroup. Explain why this subgroup is interesting.
+ Form a hypothesis test about an interesting variable, explore whether your chosen subgroup differs from the rest of sample. Please provide both a p-value for the hypothesis test and a confidence interval. Write a short paragraph explaining the test (carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test.
+ With a linear probability model (OLS), can you find relevant information to predict an interesting outcome? How good is the model? Discuss. Include hypothesis tests about individual or joint coefficient values. Include some predicted values.
+ Now how does a logit model perform? What additional information can you learn from that? Discuss. Include hypothesis tests about individual or joint coefficient values. Include some predicted values.
+ Can you estimate some other models? What is the marginal value of those? Impress me.

1. According to the crosstabs, it's likely that those with higher levels of education land jobs that offer health insurance. Additionally those who work full 
time are more likely to recieve health insurance from employers compared to those that work part time. Although there aren't all that many, it'd be better to
exclude NA, IDK, or refused responses all together. The grouping can be separated as bachlors degree and above as one group and everything below as another. This
can indicate what value a college degree plays on employment benefits.
2. The negative coefficients signifiy an inverse relationship between age and having an employer that offers health insurance/benefits for females. Since 30 is on 
the younger end of the age range, they are more likely to be offered health insurance by their job, which makes sense considering that younger people tend to have 
less health problems. On the other hand, it's more difficult and expensive to get health care coverage for older folks, so emplyers hiring those on the higher end 
of the age range may be more hesitant to offer them health insurance. As age increases by each unit, the probability of being offered insurance drops by the
coefficient.
3.

#I began by subsetting to people over the age of 25 but under 65 with health insurance, working fulltime in a workplace that does offer health insurance. We would
expect those under 25 to generally be healthy anyway.

# My hypothesis is that those with health insurance are more likely to have a higher BMI as age increases, possibly by 8 points or more. This is possibly due to 
the fact that those with health insurance are going to be more careless with their health, since their medical costs are covered. Additionally, since they are 
working full time, they are more likely to eat meals away from home leading to greater weight gain as age increases. This would mean that we don't reject the null
hypothesis if the increase in BMI is less than 8.

#according to the regression, the increase is not significant enough to reject the null hypothesis.
